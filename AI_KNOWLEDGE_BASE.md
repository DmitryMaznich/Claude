# 🧠 INTERNAL KNOWLEDGE BASE FOR AI

This file contains answers to common questions that are NOT effectively answered by the website content.
The AI must use this information to answer user questions about these specific topics.

## 🧹 Hygiene & Cleaning
**Q: How often is the laundromat cleaned?**
A: Every day.

**Q: How are the washing machine drums disinfected?**
A: They are disinfected during daily cleaning using a special disinfectant. Additionally, a special disinfecting agent is automatically added to the drum during every wash cycle to destroy all harmful bacteria.

## 🐾 Pets & Specific Items
**Q: Can I wash pet items (bedding, rugs, clothes)?**
A: It is not desirable to wash pet items in the regular machines. However, complete control over this is difficult. Therefore, if you are concerned about hygiene, we recommend always using the disinfectant spray (which is available at the laundromat) to spray the drum before loading your laundry.

**Q: Can I wash shoes?**
A: NO. Washing shoes in our machines is strictly PROHIBITED. Shoes can damage the drum and the heavy tumbling can damage the shoes themselves.

## 🧴 Detergents
**Q: Can I turn off the automatic detergent supply? I want to use my own.**
A: NO, it is not possible. Although theoretically possible, the system is integrated and automatic. We do not allow disabling it.

**Q: Can I add my own detergent?**
A: It is not recommended. Our machines automatically dispense professional detergent, softener, and disinfectant. Adding your own may cause oversudsing and affect the wash quality.

**Q: What kind of detergents do you use? Are they hypoallergenic?**
A: We use high-quality commercial detergents from various manufacturers (Slavic and Italian). They are typically hypoallergenic and have a neutral scent (no strong perfume).

## 🏪 Staff & Assistance
**Q: Is there anyone at the laundromat to help me?**
A: NO. The laundromat is strictly self-service; there is no staff on site.

**Q: What if I have a problem or don't know how to use the machines?**
A: The process is very simple and designed for anyone to use. Instructions are clearly displayed. If you encounter any issues, please call our hotline immediately (contact info is on the walls) or type "/operator" here to chat with us.

## 🧺 Laundry Etiquette & Usage
**Q: What if a machine has finished but the owner isn't there, and I need to wash?**
A: It is the owner's responsibility to retrieve their laundry on time. If a cycle has finished and the owner is absent, you may carefully remove their items, place them in a laundry basket or on a clean surface with reasonable care, and use the machine.

**Q: Is it safe to leave my laundry in the washer?**
A: YES. The washing machine locks the door for the entire duration of the program (approx. 40 minutes). No one can open it or take your items while the cycle is running.

**Q: I can't open the dryer door! Is it locked?**
A: NO. Dryers use strong magnets, not locks. They do not lock even during operation (so you can check dryness). If it feels stuck, simply pull harder.

## 💡 EXPERT LAUNDRY TIPS (General Guidelines)
*Please note: Always check the care label on your item FIRST. These are general guidelines.*

### 🌡️ Temperature Guide by Fabric
| Fabric | Temp | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| **Cotton (White)** | 60°C - 95°C | Can withstand high heat. |
| **Cotton (Color)** | 40°C | Lower temp prevents fading. |
| **Synthetics** | 30°C - 40°C | Polyester, nylon, spandex. High heat damages fibers. |
| **Jeans/Denim** | 30°C - 40°C | Wash inside out to preserve color. |
| **Bedding** | 40°C - 60°C | 60°C is good for hygiene if fabric allows. |
| **Towels** | 60°C | Ensures good hygiene. |
| **Wool/Silk** | 30°C | **WARNING:** Only if machine has a specific delicate/wool cycle. NEVER use high heat. |
| **Down Jackets** | 30°C - 40°C | Delicate cycle. **MUST** be dried in dryer on low/medium heat to restore fluffiness. |

### 🏷️ Common Care Symbols
- **Tub with water**: Washing allowed. Number inside = max temperature.
- **Triangle**: Bleaching (Empty = ok, Crossed out = no).
- **Square with circle**: Tumble drying allowed.
    - 1 dot = low heat
    - 2 dots = medium heat
    - Crossed out = Do NOT tumble dry
- **Iron**: Ironing allowed. (Dots indicate temp).
- **Circle**: Dry cleaning only.

### 🚫 Common Mistakes to Avoid
1.  **Overloading the machine**: Clothes need space to move to get clean. If packed too tight, they won't wash well.
2.  **Wrong Temperature**: Washing wool or silk in hot water will shrink them.
3.  **Drying Wool in Dryer**: **NEVER** put wool in the dryer; it will shrink instantly.
4.  **Washing Down Jackets incorrectly**: They MUST be dried in a dryer to fluff up the feathers, otherwise they will smell and clump.
