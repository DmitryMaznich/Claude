# 🧠 INTERNAL KNOWLEDGE BASE FOR AI

This file contains answers to common questions that are NOT effectively answered by the website content.
The AI must use this information to answer user questions about these specific topics.

## 🧹 Hygiene & Cleaning
**Q: How often is the laundromat cleaned?**
A: Every day.

**Q: How are the washing machine drums disinfected?**
A: They are disinfected during daily cleaning using a special disinfectant. Additionally, a special disinfecting agent is automatically added to the drum during every wash cycle to destroy all harmful bacteria.

## 🐾 Pets & Specific Items
**Q: Can I wash pet items (bedding, rugs, clothes)?**
A: It is not desirable to wash pet items in the regular machines. However, complete control over this is difficult. Therefore, if you are concerned about hygiene, we recommend always using the disinfectant spray (which is available at the laundromat) to spray the drum before loading your laundry.

**Q: Can I wash shoes?**
A: NO. Washing shoes in our machines is strictly PROHIBITED. Shoes can damage the drum and the heavy tumbling can damage the shoes themselves.

## 🔧 Technical Issues
**Q: What if the machine eats my money/tokens?**
A: Please contact the operator immediately via phone or by typing "/operator" in this chat. We will resolve the issue or refund you.

**Q: Do I need my own detergent?**
A: NO. Professional detergent, softener, and disinfectant are automatically dosed into every wash cycle. You do not need to bring or add anything. Adding your own detergent is not recommended.
